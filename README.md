# SteerNet

This repository contains the code for generating the dataset, train the model and use steernet.

## Audio samples

Here are some audio samples that demonstrate the separation performance of SteerNet with the geometry of various commercially available microphone arrays. Note that the reverberation and signal-to-noise ratio vary from one sample to the other, which can also impact the separation performances.
